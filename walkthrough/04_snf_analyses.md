# Reproducing the analyses

Now that everything is installed and downloaded and pre-processed, you likely want to run the analyses!
Assuming we set everything up correctly (fingers crossed), the following command, run from the root of the repository, should do the trick:

```bash
make all
```

You'll get a whole lot of outputs and numbers printed to the screen, most of which should match those we report in the associated manuscript.
(If something seems amiss, please [let us know](https://github.com/netneurolab/markello_ppmisnf/issues)!)

Below, we'll describe what each script that the above commands runs is doing in a bit more detail.

## Preparing for SNF

## The SNF procedure

## Data concatenation versus SNF

## PD patient biotypes

## MRI contributions

## Diffusion embedding

## Supplementary analyses
